Engineering 4

1. If you're controlling a flying object, watch it carefully. Especially if it's valuable.
2. LSM303 accelerometers can determine their orientation by measuring the earth's local magnetic field, as long as you don't need it to be too precise.
3. Milled, printed, or soldered flat circuit boards are a lot less messy than breadboards.
4. If your npm commands fail due to an error with node-gyp, it might be because the package can't find your installation of a dependency, such as Visual Studio Build Tools. 
5. If you want to propel a vehicle with a jet engine, use an engine with two counter-rotating sets of blades. A single set creates a gyroscope, which can lead to unpredictable effects when attempting to turn.
